# Vesting

By supplying collateral to the protocol to be borrowed for leveraged positions, NECC is redistributed in return.

NECC is vested over five days at a discount by selling NDOL or NDOL/NECC LP principal to the protocol treasury.

NECC could also be swapped on a secondary market like an AMM that should trade above underlying collateral basket price inside the treasury.

As the treasury owns more principal overtime, NDOL and NECC pricing stabilises providing the protocol sustained revenue and risk free asset allocation for roadmap development.

Given a decentralised and stable price, NECC itself can be utilised in permissionless & partnership markets as well as treasury sharing to survive multiple bear markets.

1% of vested NECC is redistributed to interest bearing stablecoin stakers for sustained APY.

NECC DAO funds can also be used for roadmap implementation and LP fee earning and aiding NDOL weighting.
