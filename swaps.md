# Swaps

NAKA debt** **measured for tokenA is pushed towards tokenB, the user receives no spread but pays a competitive 0.3% swap fee in tokenA.

Traders can also put down another collateral to perform a debt swap before speculating on another index token.

(Trader puts down NAKA collateral to open a 2X ETH long position but gets paid out in ETH)

NOTE - Dedicated UI page for swaps is coming but collateral swaps can be done by minting and burning NAKA
