description: Yield for NAKA and Necc stakers

# Staking

In return for supplying collateral tokens to the Necc protocol, Necc yield tokens are distributed to NAKA stablecoin _and_ NECC stakers.

\---

Below is an illustration of how the protocol can be used for farming yield after minting the stablecoin:

Alice wants to sell her tokens and get yield until she is ready to risk on again.

* Alice sells 1 ETH at a price of 1 ETH / 2000 USD to the system.
* Alice receives for her 1 ETH, `(2000 USD - (0.3% swap fee :- 6USD) = 1994 NAKA.`
* Alice stakes her 1994 NAKA and receives variable APR in the form of NECC yield tokens.
  * Her yield comes from other users bonding principal tokens for NECC at a 1% bond fee rate.
* Alice can also stake her NECC tokens for further yield instead of swapping them on secondary markets.
* Alice can swap her 1994 NAKA for ETH or any other token inside the system when she is ready to risk on again.
* Alice can also gain long or short leverage on any volatile token in the system with 50x leverage or use it somewhere else with integration partners.
* Alice could also repeat the same process with her other whitelisted volatile tokens!
