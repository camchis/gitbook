# Future products

Future areas of research for Necc protocol are:

* Something like Gauntlet Network on how to best distribute incentivised yield to balance the collaterals (oSushi as a reference - [https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushinomics-introducing-osushi/4055](https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushinomics-introducing-osushi/4055))
* Model Parameter tuning of fees
* Strategically buying puts for the basket of collaterals to keep NAKA pegged
* Structured products on top of the system i.e. Zap into a vault to get the best NAKA mint fee rate and help rebalance demand
* Synthetic tokens with Chainlink price oracles to speculate on
* Everlasting options with a EWMA floating strike price
* Yield fee tiers
* Undercollateralised loans/leverage due an overcollateralised NAKA and user reputation
* Permissionless markets with linear perps denominated in NECC
* Partnership markets with inverse perps and treasury sharing
* Crosschain liquidity rebalancing incentives for arbitrageurs
