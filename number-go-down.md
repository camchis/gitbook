description: So what happens if we have a bear market?

# Number go down

As the price of the underlying supplied collateral in the Necc protocol goes down,

* Ideally we have had a performant bull market before the bear market so the Necc protocol is over collateralised with fees from usage.
* Users will take profits into stablecoins which are supplied into the Necc protocol to farm Necc** **on the market downtrend.
* Linear shorts are open so stablecoins are reserved to stabilise nUSD price as they can be used for linear short payouts
* The price of nUSD drops slightly as it is an index weighted stablecoin so its underlying volatile basket weighted collateral has had a price drop too but the stablecoin collateral and isolated collateral redemption ratios act as a buy walls when it comes to redemptions
* Arbitrageurs can take advantage of the cheap nUSD on secondary markets and redeem it for underlying stablecoins within the protocol and reduce system debt for profit
* The volatile collateral redemption rate will drop, early redeemers get less collateral back and system debt will be reduced
* A price drop in BTC does not affect ETH collateral redemption aiding to the index weighted stable price of nUSD
* Overall Long liquidations + fees > short profits and repegging
