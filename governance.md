# Governance

Necc can be used to vote as well as being a productive fee/basket collateral backed token.

Necc** **allows the following parameters within the protocol to be governed:

* Maximum Leverage
* Maximum nUSD mint caps per collateral
* Withdrawal fees
* Swap fees
* Stables swap fees
* Borrowing/Margin fees
* Liquidation fees
* Whitelisted tokens
* Shortable tokens
* Redemption fees
* Minimum profit fees
* Funding Rate factors and intervals
* Price feeds
* Treasury fees

[https://snapshot.org](https://snapshot.org) will be used for voting

Non-governed variants of Necc protocol could be deployed resulting in:

* Fixed fee parameters or set by the team up to a fixed reasonable maximum
* Deploy variants of the same system but with different basket of collaterals thus leading to multiple stablecoins and yield tokens (think AltPerp, ShitPerp indexes from FTX)
