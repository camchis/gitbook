# Number go up

As the price of the underlying supplied collateral in the Necc protocol goes up,

* The protocol will be over collateralised overtime as the redemption rate + fees reduces the collateral ratio.
* People can use their minted NAKA as collateral within the system, increasing their leverage position size to risk on.
* The funding rates go up with increased demand meaning it costs fees to borrow more collateral from the system on open long and short positions.
* Plebs who dump their NECC get rekt and left behind.
