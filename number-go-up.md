# Number go up

As the price of the underlying supplied collateral in the Necc protocol goes up,

* The protocol will be over collateralised overtime as the redemption rate + fees reduces the collateral ratio.
* People can redeem their Necc for more collateral within the system, increasing their leverage position size.
* The funding rates may go positive meaning it costs fees to borrow more collateral from the system on open long positions.
* Ideally these funding rates will get farmed as people take profit then supply more stable coin collateral types to encourage shorting the overextended collateral type they took profit on (further stabilising the redemption rate for Necc** **and price of the collateral type).
* Plebs who redeem their Necc earlier get a lower the redemption rate and essentially get less collateral back so we incentivise to not get rekt by selling too early.
